# Open Asset Import Library (custom version)

A custom fork of Assimp, primarily to support MinGW compilation on Windows.

(MinGW support is not 100% maintained in the main repo)

- Main goal is to successfully build DLL-s and lib-s.

- Secondary Assimp features may not work or skip compilation.

- See the parent repo for the original version: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
